`slimdump` is a little tool to help you creating configurable dumps of large MySQL-databases. It works off one or several configuration files. For every table you specify, it can dump only the schema (`CREATE TABLE ...` statement), full table data, data without blobs and more.

## Why?

We created `slimdump` because we often need to dump parts of MySQL databases in a convenient and reproducible way. Also, when you need to analyze problems with data from your production databases, you might want to pull only relevant parts of data and also hide personal data (user names, for example).

`mysqldump` is a great tool, probably much more proven when it comes to edge cases and with a lot of switches. But there is no easy way to create a simple configuration file that describes a particular type of dump (e. g. a subset of your tables) and share it with your co-workers. Let alone dumping tables and omitting BLOB type columns. 

## Installation

When PHP is your everyday programming language, you probably have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed. You can then easily install `slimdump` as a [global package](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#global). Just run `composer global require webfactory/slimdump`. In order to use it like any other Unix command, make sure `$COMPOSER_HOME/vendor/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

Of course, you can also add `slimdump` as a local (per-project) Composer dependency.

We're also working on providing a `.phar` package of `slimdump` for those not using PHP regularly. With that solution, all you need is to have the PHP interpreter installed and to download a single archive file to use `slimdump`. You can help us and open a pull request for that :-)!

## Usage
`slimdump` needs the DSN for the database to dump and one or more config files:

`slimdump {DSN} {config-file} [...more config files...]`

`slimdump` writes to STDOUT. If you want your dump written to a file, just redirect the output:

`slimdump {DSN} {config-file} > dump.sql`

The DSN has to be in the following format:

`mysql://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/dbname`

For further explanations have a look at the [Doctrine documentation](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html#connecting-using-a-url).

## Configuration
Configuration is stored in XML format somewhere in your filesystem. As a benefit, you could add the configuration to your repository to share a quickstart to your database dump with your coworkers.

Example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<slimdump>
  <!-- Create a full dump (schema + data) of "some_table" -->
  <table name="some_table" dump="full" />
  
  <!-- Dump the "media" table, omit BLOB fields. -->
  <table name="media" dump="noblob" />
  
  <!-- Dump the "user" table, hide names and email addresses. -->
  <table name="user" dump="full">
      <column name="username" dump="masked" />
      <column name="email" dump="masked" />
      <column name="password" dump="replace" replacement="test" />
  </table>
  
  <!-- Dump the "document" table but do not pass the "AUTO_INCREMENT" parameter to the SQL query.
       Instead start to increment from the beginning -->
  <table name="document" dump="full" keep-auto-increment="false" />
</slimdump>
```

### Conditions

You may want to select only some rows. In that case you can define a condition on a table.

Example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<slimdump>
  <!-- Dump all users whose usernames begin with foo -->
  <table name="user" dump="full" condition="`username` LIKE 'foo%'" />
</slimdump>
```

### Dump modes

The following modes are supported for the `dump` attribute:
* `none` - Table is not dumped at all. Makes sense if you use broad wildcards (see below) and then want to exclude a specific table.
* `schema` - Only the table schema will be dumped
* `noblob` - Will dump a `NULL` value for BLOB fields
* `full` - Whole table will be dumped
* `masked` - Replaces all chars with "x". Mostly makes sense when applied on the column level, for example for email addresses or user names.
* `replace` - Replace a column with a static value. Useful e.g. to replace passwords with a static one.

### Wildcards
Of course you can use wildcards for table names (* for multiple characters, ? for a single character).

Example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<slimdump>
  <!-- Default: dump all tables -->
  <table name="*" dump="full" />
  
  <!-- Dump all tables beginning with "a_" as schema -->
  <table name="a_*" dump="schema" />
  
  <!-- Dump "big_blob_table" without blobs -->
  <table name="big_blob_table" dump="noblob" />
  
  <!-- Do not dump any tables ending with "_test" -->
  <table name="*_test" dump="none" />
</slimdump>
```
This is a valid configuration. If more than one instruction matches a specific table name, the most specific one will be used. E. g. if you have definitions for blog_* and blog_author, the latter will be used for your author table, independent of their sequence order in the config.

## Other databases
Currently only MySQL is supported. But feel free to port it to the database of your needs.

## Development

### Building the Phar

Download [Box](https://github.com/box-project/box2) into the project root:

    curl -LSs https://box-project.github.io/box2/installer.php | php
    
Install dependencies via Composer:

    php composer.phar install
    
Start the Phar build:

    ./box.phar build -v
   
Use slimdump as Phar:

    ./slimdump.phar {DSN} {config-file}
    
### Tests

You can execute the phpunit-tests by calling `vendor/bin/phpunit`.
